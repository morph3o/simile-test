# Simile Test Project

This is an example project to prove our approach and proof-of-concept called [Simile](https://github.com/morph3o/simile). 
This proof-of-concept is an application that explores a Java-based project in order to recommend similar components using
[SOCORA](http://socora.merobase.com/socora/app/index.html).
 
This project simulates a Base64 library which implements the methods encode and decode which follows the 
[RFC 4648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648).
